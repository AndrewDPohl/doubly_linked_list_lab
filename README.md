# Doubly Linked List Lab??
## Reading Up


We don't really want to do too much with linked list on this first day, and we will get more into the implementation in the following days. Let's review the applications of a linked list: queue and stack.

## Exercises

1.) Let's implement a naive `Queue` class using an `Array` instead of a linked list.
  * You'll need a `Queue` class
    * You'll need a `list` attribute for each new `Queue` that will just be an `Array`.
    * You'll need two methods `push` and `pop`
  * Write you solution in the `naive_queue.rb` file.
2.) Let's implement a naive `Stack` class using an `Array` instead of a linked list.
  * You'll need a `Stack` class
    * You'll need a `list` attribute for each new `Stack` that will just be an `Array`.
    * You'll need two methods `push` and `pop`
  * Write you solution in the `naive_stack.rb` file.
3.) Let's rewrite our `Queue` using JavaScript. 
  * You'll need a `Queue` constructor function
    * You'll need a `list` hasOwnProperty for each new `Queue` that will just be a new `Array`.
    * You'll need two prototype methods `push` and `pop`
  * Write you solution in the `naive_queue.js` file.
4.) Let's rewrite our `Stack` using JavaScript. 
  * You'll need a `Stack` constructor
    * You'll need a `list` hasOwnProperty for each new `Stack` that will just be an `Array`.
    * You'll need two methods `push` and `pop` prototype properties.
  * Write you solution in the `naive_stack.js` file.
