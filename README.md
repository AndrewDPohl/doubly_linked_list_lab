# Doubly Linked List Lab??
## Reading Up


We don't really want to do too much with linked list on this first day, and we will get more into the implementation in the following days. Let's review the applications of a linked list: queue and stack.

## Exercises

1.) Let's implement a naive `Queue` class using an `Array` instead of a linked list.
  * You'll need a `Queue` class
    * You'll need a `list` attribute for each new `Queue` that will just be an `Array`.
    * You'll need two methods `push` and `pop`
  * Write you solution in the `queue.rb` file.
